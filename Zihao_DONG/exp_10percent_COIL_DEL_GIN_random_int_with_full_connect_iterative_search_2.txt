attack loop: success in 89 out of 390 instances, with 102 instances no need to attack
53 instances prediction changed after node injection with no edge perturbation
235 instances have new nodes injected into the original graph
Out of which 234 have all injected nodes connected to the graph
102 instances don't need to be attacked
